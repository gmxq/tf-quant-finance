    Args:
      forwards_asset1: A real `Tensor` of any shape. The current forward prices to
        expiry for the first underlying asset,
      volatilities_asset1: A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `forwards_asset1`. The
        volatility to expiry for the first underlying asset.
      forwards_asset2: A real `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `forwards_asset1`. The
        current forward prices toexpiry for the second underlying asset, for two underlying options.
      volatilities_asset2: A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `forwards_asset1`. The
        volatility to expiry for the second underlying asset.
      expiries: A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `forwards_asset1`. The expiry
        for each option with the second underlying asset. The units should be such that
         `expiries * volatilities_asset1**2` is dimensionless.
      strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `forwards_asset1`. The
        strikes of the options to be priced.
      rho: A real 'Tenor' of the same and dtype as 'forwards_asset1'. The correlation between two
        underlying assets.
      discount_factors: A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as the `forwards_asset1`.
        The discount factors to expiry (i.e. e^(-rT)). If not specified, no
        discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted option price is returned).
        Default value: None, interpreted as discount factors = 1.
      is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with `forwards_asset1`.
        Indicates whether to compute the price of a call (if True) or a put (if
        False). If not supplied, it is assumed that every element is a call.
      dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
        of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
        Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by TensorFlow
        (float32).
      name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
        Default value: None which is mapped to the default name `spread_option_price`.

    Returns:
      spread_option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `forwards`. The kirk's
      approximation for Black Scholes price of the spread_options.
